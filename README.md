# learning_chef
Repo where I put notes and exercises relevant to my learning of chef

Important - the code in `learn_chef_cookbook` is mostly wrong as the class I took is outdated. The logic remains interesting though.
Also, cookbooks' and recipes' folder hierarchy havn't changed in recent versions (as far as I know).

One correct, yet really basic recipe can be found in `ca/cookbook/learn_chef_cookbook/recipes\simple_recipe.rb`.
